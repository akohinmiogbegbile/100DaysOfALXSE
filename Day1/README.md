# 100 Days of Front-end Coding Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Front-end Coding Challenge! This repository tracks my progress as I commit to coding daily for 100 days to enhance my skills as a front-end developer.

## Day 1 Challenge: Create a Simple HTML Webpage

**Task:**
Create a basic HTML webpage with the following components:
1. Heading (`<h1>` or `<h2>`): Give your webpage a title.
2. Paragraphs (`<p>`): Add a few paragraphs of text to describe your webpage or anything you like.
3. List (`<ul>` or `<ol>`): Include an unordered or ordered list with at least three items.

**Requirements:**
- The webpage should be well-structured and readable.
- Use appropriate HTML tags for each component.
- Add some basic styling using inline CSS or an external stylesheet (optional for now).

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 20px;
        }
        h1 {
            color: navy;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML webpage created for the 100 Days of Coding Challenge.</p>
